# Universal Code of Conduct for Wikimedia

The Universal Code of Conduct (UCoC) defines a minimum set of guidelines of expected and unacceptable behaviour across the Wikimedia movement.

---

## Why We Have a Universal Code of Conduct

We are committed to **empowering as many people as possible** to actively participate in Wikimedia projects to achieve our vision of a world where everyone can share in the sum of all human knowledge. We believe our communities must be **diverse, inclusive, accessible, positive, safe, and healthy environments**. We are also committed to **protecting our projects** against those who damage or distort content.

In line with the Wikimedia mission, all participants will:
* Help create a world in which **everyone can freely share in the sum of all knowledge**.
* Be part of a global community that will **avoid bias and prejudice**.
* **Strive towards accuracy and verifiability** in all its work.

### Scope of Application

The UCoC applies **equally to everyone** who interacts and contributes to online and offline Wikimedia projects and spaces, including:
* New and experienced contributors
* Functionaries within the projects
* Event organizers and participants
* Employees and board members of affiliates and the Wikimedia Foundation

It covers all Wikimedia projects, technical spaces, in-person and virtual events, including:
* Private, public and semi-public interactions
* Discussions of disagreement and expression of solidarity
* Issues of technical development
* Aspects of content contribution
* Cases of representing affiliates/communities with external partners

#### Technical Spaces

Specifically, this code applies to **Wikimedia technical spaces**, both physical and virtual, such as:
* **Physical:** Wikimedia technical events and technical presentations in other events.
* **Virtual:** MediaWiki.org, wikitech.wikimedia.org, Phabricator, Gerrit Code Review, technical mailing lists, technical IRC channels, Etherpad, and other development-oriented spaces operated by the Wikimedia Foundation.

## 1 – Introduction and Principles

The UCoC provides a **baseline of behaviour** for collaboration worldwide. Communities may add to this to develop local policies, but the UCoC criteria must be maintained as a **minimum standard**.

Actions that contradict the UCoC can result in **sanctions** imposed by designated functionaries and/or the Wikimedia Foundation.

**Technical skills and community status make no difference** to the right to be respected and the obligation to respect others. **Prolific contributions and technical expertise are not a justification for lower standards of behaviour.**

## 2 – Expected Behaviour

Every Wikimedian is **responsible for their own behaviour**. Behaviour will be founded in **respect, civility, collegiality, solidarity, and good citizenship**.

**No exceptions** will be made based on age, disability (physical or mental), neuroatypicality, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, national origin, religious background, caste, social class, language fluency, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, sex, political affiliation, or career field.

### 2.1 – Mutual Respect

We expect all Wikimedians to **show mutual respect** for others. This includes:
* **Practice empathy:** Listen and try to understand Wikimedians of different backgrounds.
* **Assume good faith** and engage in constructive edits. Provide and receive feedback kindly. Criticism should be delivered in a **sensitive and constructive** manner.
* **Respect the way that contributors name and describe themselves,** including specific names, terms, or pronouns.
* During in-person meetings, be **welcoming, mindful, and respectful** of each other's preferences, boundaries, sensibilities, traditions, and requirements.

### 2.2 – Civility, Collegiality, Mutual Support and Good Citizenship

We strive towards:
* **Civility:** Politeness in behaviour and speech.
* **Collegiality:** Friendly support extended between people engaged in a common effort.
* **Mutual support and good citizenship:** Taking active responsibility for ensuring that spaces are **productive, pleasant, and safe**.

This includes:
* **Mentorship and coaching:** Helping newcomers acquire essential skills. **Newcomers deserve a welcoming attitude and constructive feedback.**
* **Looking out for fellow contributors:** Lending support and speaking up when others are treated unacceptably.
* **Recognize and credit the work done by contributors.**

## 3 – Unacceptable Behaviour

The following behaviours are considered **unacceptable** in all public and private Wikimedia spaces:

### 3.1 – Harassment

Any behaviour intended primarily to **intimidate, outrage, or upset a person**, or where this is reasonably considered the most likely main outcome. This often takes the form of emotional abuse and may become harassment through **repetition**.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:
* **Insults:** Name calling, using slurs or stereotypes, and any attacks based on personal characteristics (race, gender, intelligence, etc.).
* **Sexual harassment:** Unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
* **Threats:** Explicitly or implicitly suggesting the possibility of **physical violence, unfair embarrassment, unjustified reputational harm, or threats of legal action** to win an argument.
* **Encouraging harm to others:** Including encouraging self-harm, suicide, or violent attacks on a third party.
* **Disclosure of personal data (Doxing):** Sharing other contributors' private information (name, address, workplace, etc.) **without their explicit consent** on or off Wikimedia projects. Disclosure of *some* identifying information is **not** consent to disclose *other* identifying information.
* **Hounding:** Following a person across projects and repeatedly critiquing their work mainly with the intent to upset or discourage them.
* **Trolling:** Deliberately disrupting conversations or posting in bad-faith to intentionally provoke (i.e., **sustained disruption, interruption, or blocking of community collaboration**).
* **Unwanted attention, touching, or physical contact** (sexual or otherwise).
* **Unwanted photography or recording.**

### 3.2 – Abuse of Power, Privilege, or Influence

Engaging in disrespectful, cruel, and/or violent behaviour from a real or perceived position of power.

This includes:
* **Abuse of office by functionaries, officials, and staff:** Using authority, knowledge, or resources to intimidate or threaten others.
* **Abuse of seniority and connections:** Using one's position and reputation to intimidate others.
* **Psychological manipulation:** Maliciously causing someone to doubt their own perceptions with the objective to win an argument or force compliance.
* **Using the code of conduct system for purposes other than reporting genuine violations** (e.g., retaliation).
* **Attempting to circumvent a decision** of the Committee (e.g., unblocking a banned person).

### 3.3 – Content Vandalism and Abuse of the Projects

Deliberately introducing biased, false, inaccurate or inappropriate content, or hindering content creation/maintenance.

This includes:
* The **repeated arbitrary or unmotivated removal of any content** without appropriate discussion or explanation.
* **Systematically manipulating content** to favour specific interpretations or points of view.
* **Hate speech** in any form, or discriminatory language aimed at vilifying, humiliating, inciting hatred against individuals or groups. **Discrimination, particularly against marginalised and otherwise underrepresented groups,** is unacceptable. (Targeted outreach to such groups is allowed and encouraged.)
* The use of **symbols, images, categories, tags or other kinds of content** that are intimidating or harmful outside of encyclopedic or informational use.

## Reporting a Problem

In case of **threats of harm and other urgent situations**, notify the relevant authorities first (if possible) and **email the Wikimedia Foundation** via `emergency@wikimedia.org`.

People who experience or observe unacceptable behaviour are encouraged to follow any of these steps:
1. **Ask the person who is behaving unacceptably to stop.** Make them aware of this Code of Conduct.
2. If at an event, **report the problem to the event organizers** or a designated contact.
3. **Report the problem directly to the Code of Conduct Committee** via `techconduct@wikimedia.org`. Reports are processed **confidentially**.

Reports can include:
* Your contact information, if you choose to identify yourself.
* Your account of the incident, including:
    * Where and when it happened.
    * A description of the unacceptable behaviour.
    * Who was involved and who saw it happen.
